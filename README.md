# Hex
The objective of the project was to model the Hex game with a computer, create a visual interface to play the board game and create an efficient computer program which can play autonomously.

The program is divided into 3 main facets: the GUI, the autonomous agent, and the storage system for the games.

The GUI allows for the user to play the game of hex on their computer, either against another human player or against the computer. The autonomous agent allows players to hone their hex skills and improve their general cognitive ability and logical reasoning. The storage system allows players to save their games and review them at a later time.

The AI is driven by MCTS(Monte Carlo Tree Search) algorithm optimised with RAVE(Rapid Action Value Estimation).
